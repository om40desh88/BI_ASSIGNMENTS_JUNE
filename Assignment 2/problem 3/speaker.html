                <h1>Aaron Irizarry</h1>
                <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
                <p> Workplace culture doesnt start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesnt end
                    with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. Its the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
                    motivations that enable good work to get done, or its what stifles a workforce. For design to be
                    most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design
                    and allows it to succeed.
                    <br>
                    In Aarons session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                    both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others
                    dont, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplaces culture. Once youve worked
                    within a culture of design its almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
                </p>

                <h4>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h4>
                <p> Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
                    narrative and effective storytelling technique. Its the filmmakers job to put this together. To do
                    so theyve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
                    information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.

                    With this workshop, well revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical
                    aspects used in film to communicate. Well look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic
                    patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. Well consider why theyre used and how we might look to them
                    for inspiration.
                </p>

                <p> JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,

                <h4> DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h4>
                <p> Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better
                    by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions.
                    Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases
                    collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.

                <h4>WHAT DESIGNERS AND STRATEGISTS CAN LEARN FROM DICK FOSBURY</h4>
                <p> Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the
                    high jump with an unorthodox “back first” technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His
                    innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with
                    sportswriters labeling him “the worlds laziest high jumper” — but today variations of the Fosbury
                    Flop are used by almost every high jumper.

                    We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device
                    interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences
                    realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to “save” information, push buttons as control devices and
                    typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.

                    As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to
                    free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the
                    future.

                <h4> WHAT DISNEY CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN</h4>
                <p> From the creation of the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, to newer animated films such as
                    The Princess and the Frog, to the branded “Wonderful World of Disney” itself, the Disney empire has
                    been built upon a design ecosystem. Each film, theme park, or cruise shares a holistic view of a
                    perfect world across time and cultures. Within each experience, the same beloved character traits
                    are highlighted, similar visual and animation styles are used, and the same story and musical
                    techniques are leveraged to bring the audience to an emotional place. This helps make the user
                    experience familiar and nostalgic, and lightens the audiences cognitive load to promote enjoyment.
                    Join Erica as she highlights Disneys user experience techniques and outlines how you can use them
                    to design an ecosystem that will leave behind a lasting legacy, even while waiting in an extremely
                    long line.

                <h4>TEACHING OUR CSS TO PLAY NICE</h4>
                <p> Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our
                    CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling,
                    surly teenaged CSS that doesnt always play nice with others. We need to learn how to manage and
                    optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we start early, we can use
                    best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to
                    work with.
